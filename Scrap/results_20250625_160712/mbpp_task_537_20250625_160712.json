If it has, the function returns that word immediately because we're looking for the first repeated word.\n- If the word hasn't been seen before, it's added to the `seen_words` set.\n- After checking all words, if no repeated word was found, the function returns `None`.\n\nThe provided test cases demonstrate how the function behaves with different inputs.",
